Portfolio
##Introduction This is the current version of my portfolio. The main focus of the update was to add user-interactivity and animation. Through this work, I learned that you can implement classes (finally!) and gained a basic understanding of canvas. I was inspired by the Bauhaus movement. I love that style of art and design. 

##Technologies Bootstrap 4, JS, canvas element.
